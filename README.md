My solutions to the examples presented in ai-junkie.com on genetic algorithm.

Link: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html

There are 2 folders: 

- genetic_algo_1: Given the digits 0 through 9 and the operators +, -, * and /,  find a sequence that will represent a given target number. The operators will be applied sequentially from left to right as you read.

- twiddlywinks: Given an area that has a number of non overlapping disks scattered about its surface, use a genetic algorithm to find the disk of largest radius which may be placed amongst these disks without overlapping any of them

Enjoy!
